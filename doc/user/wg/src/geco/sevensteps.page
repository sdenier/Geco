# Seven Steps to manage an O' event with Geco

Don't know where to start? Never use a full-featured O software before? Here is a quick guide to manage an orienteering event: seven steps to handle the race organization. Read on for starters.

1\. Use the [Launcher] and the [Stage] panel to set up a new stage.

2\. Load courses from within the [Stage] panel.

3\. Register competitors from the [Runners] panel and using the [Archive].

4\. Check E-card configuration in the [Stage] panel and click the Reader button in the [Toolbar].

Runners download their e-card in the reader to check their status and get their split times.

4bis. Resolve problems directly in the [Runners] panel and using the [Merge] dialog (read [automatic](../howtos/index.html) mode first).

5\. Print intermediate [Results].

6\. Don't forget to check [unresolved statuses](../howtos/endstage.html) to see if everyone is finished.

7\. Generate final [Results] for publishing and analysis.
