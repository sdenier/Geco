#What's new?

##Version 1.1
Geco 1.1 is a move from the custom app for Orient'Show to a full-featured app for regular Orienteering events, with many new features and UI improvements.

The big changes:
- easy registration through CSV import and competitors archive
- automatic mode to handle registration from archive when reading unknown e-cards, with course detection from the trace
- split format for printing and export (OE format for RouteGadget...)
- ability to use registered start times instead of a start box
- translation available in french and english (both app and doc)

UI/Usability changes:
- many UI changes
- List serial ports to let user choose. Detect the serial port where the SI box is connected
- hyperlink navigation to quickly focus on an e-card from the shortlog (runners panel)
- more universal and new keybindings

Other changes:
- new status and stats to better manage special cases (competitors still running, unknown and duplicate e-cards for automatic mode)
- new data fields for each competitor: registered start time, archive id for competitor, flag for rented e-card
- a default course can be linked to a category (use when performing registration through CSV or archive)
- introduce Functions to perform batch operations on data
- CSV export format for French CN (Classement National) + CN simulation in results
- HTML result files can be styled with CSS
- better handling of files with different charsets across platforms

Architecture/Code:
- Controls can register themselves as services and get simple access to each other.
- Refactoring ResultBuilder class and related: split between result builder and result/split exporter
- \[Mac\] update to latest Java Mac revision
- Some changes in data files to support 1.1 features
