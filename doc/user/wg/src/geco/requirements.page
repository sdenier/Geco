# Requirements

What do you need to run Geco?
- A recent JRE (Java Runtime Environment, version 6+)
- Geco bundle: it includes the application, template files for a race, user documentation, native libraries for serial communication (RXTX)
- SportIdent drivers 
  - Windows: check sportident website
  - Linux: recent kernels recognize the chip used by SI station, so it's plug'n'play
  - Mac OS X: nothing out of the box, but it is easy to install some driver and get Mac OS to recognize the station (one line to hack). Contact me for the process

## RXTX library
In some cases, you may need to install and compile RXTX drivers (serial drivers for the Java platform). Contact me if you need some help.
