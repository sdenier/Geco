# Features

Geco currently supports the Sportident timing system.

In 1.1, Geco introduces an [automatic](../howtos/index.html) mode, which can be used to handle an event without pre-registration.
- automatically insert new entries when downloading e-cards
- detect the course from the punch trace in e-card
- look up for new entries in archive to retrieve name, club, category...

Geco UI is organized as a series of panels in tabs, each dedicated to one aspect of the race.

- [Stage] to configure stage, clubs, courses, categories
  - import course from the IOF XML format
  - change Orient'Show parameters
- [Runners] to register competitors and manage issues during the race
  - register runners in CSV file or using an archive
  - get a detailed view of race data for each runner, including trace of punches
  - manage special cases using the merge dialog
- [Results] to generate rankings and splits
  - export results in html and csv formats, with multiple options
  - automatically export results for live update
  - French National Ranking calculator
- [Log] to get race statistics and perform batch operations
- [Heats] to generate heats from results for the next stage in knockout qualifications

Read the [UI Guide] for documentation about each panel.

Geco presents some features dedicated to Orient'Show:
- time penalties and MP limit
- accurate count of MPs and detailed trace
- management of knockout qualifications
