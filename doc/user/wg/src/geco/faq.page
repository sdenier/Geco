# FAQ


## How to customize result sheets?
Tweaking the result sheets is possible by editing their CSS style in the stage directory. For now it is mostly useful when ticket size is not adapted to your printer.
- edit `result.css` for ranking results, CN, split times in multi-columns format
- edit `ticket.css` for split times in ticket format


## Future features
The following features are not currently supported but should be part of future releases.
- reading SPORTident (start|clear|control) boxes to automatically detect and set DNS competitors
- spool printing of split times when split printer was stopped for a while
- insertion of missing punches for competitors, removal of a control from courses


## Reading SPORTident e-cards takes an usually long time
Users can experience a long time to read SPORTident e-cards on some computers: it takes around 10 seconds to read one e-card instead of the normal 1 or 2 seconds. This makes Geco impractical for any event except testing. The problem seems to appear only when the SPORTident master station is plugged directly into the computer. Although the root cause of this problem is unknown (any tip welcomed!), the problem has always disappeared when plugging a USB hub between the computer and the SPORTident station. A typical set up we use is to plug the master station and the split printer into the hub: this leaves enough free plugs for other devices such as a regular printer or USB keys.


## How to install SPORTident driver on Mac OS X?

The trick is to download the Mac OS driver for the USB chip onboard SPORTident boxes, then changes some bits of the driver so that Mac OS links the SPORTident box with this driver.

1\. Download and install the driver from [SI labs](https://www.silabs.com/products/interface/usbtouart/Pages/usb-to-uart-bridge.aspx), section *Tools*, choose *CP210x VCP Mac OSX Drivers* (or try the direct link to [Mac\_OSX\_VCP\_Driver.zip](https://www.silabs.com/pages/DownloadDoc.aspx?FILEURL=Support%20Documents/Software/Mac_OSX_VCP_Driver.zip&src=SoftwardDownloadsWebPart)). The driver needs a restart.

2\. Open file `/System/Library/Extensions/SiLabsUSBDriver.kext/Contents/Info.plist` with a text editor. Plist files in Mac OS describes various kinds of property in a XML format.
You can make a backup copy of the file before edition.

Inside the file, copy the full XML entry for the **SiLabsUSBDriver - SILabs 60000 CP210x** and paste it as a new entry. Change the **idProduct** from 60000 (0xEA6) to 32778 (0x800A). SPORTident stations have a USB product id of 32778 and thus will be recognized and interfaced with this USB driver.

Alternatively, you can directly copy the following entry within the right tags:

<pre>
&lt;key&gt;SiLabsUSBDriver - SILabs 60000 CP210x&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
&lt;key&gt;CFBundleIdentifier&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;com.silabs.driver.SiLabsUSBDriver&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;IOClass&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;SiLabsUSBDriver&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;IOKitDebug&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;integer&gt;0&lt;/integer&gt;
&lt;key&gt;IOMatchCategory&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;SiLabsUSBSerial&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;IOProviderClass&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;IOUSBDevice&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;IOResourceMatch&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;IOKit&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;IOUserClientClass&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;SiLabsUSBUserClient&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;USB Product Name&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;CP210x USB to UART Bridge Controller&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;bConfigurationValue&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;integer&gt;1&lt;/integer&gt;
&lt;key&gt;bInterfaceNumber&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;integer&gt;0&lt;/integer&gt;
&lt;key&gt;idProduct&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;integer&gt;32778&lt;/integer&gt;
&lt;key&gt;idVendor&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;integer&gt;4292&lt;/integer&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
</pre>


3\. Run the following command in a terminal to reload the modified driver:

<pre>
sudo kextunload -b com.silabs.driver.SiLabsUSBDriver
sudo kextload -b com.silabs.driver.SiLabsUSBDriver
</pre>

Alternatively, the driver may have the following identifier (see content of Info.plist for the right identifier):

<pre>
sudo kextunload -b com.silabs.driver.CP210xVCPDriver
sudo kextload -b com.silabs.driver.CP210xVCPDriver
</pre>

Or you can restart your computer so that the system takes into account the new property.

Now the station should appear as **/dev/tty.SLAB\_USBtoUART** in Geco (also appear in the System profiler as **SPORTident USB to UART Bridge Controller**).
