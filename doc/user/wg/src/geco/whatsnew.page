#What's new?

##Version 1.2 - 2011/11/30

Geco 1.2 is an intermediate release, which nonetheless ships with significant changes.
It paves the way for the future versions of Geco, providing some core changes in the UI and data model.

Here is the list of visible changes.
- Geco now explicitly handles [different formats](features.html) for orienteering races: in particular it adapts the UI to each format (config options, custom tabs...). Current formats include Classic inline, Orient'Show, and Free Order. Raid Orient'Alpin is a custom format but should be considered experimental.
- Reworked [configuration tab](../guide/stage.html) (each configuration item now has its own panel). 
- New [launch wizard](../guide/index.html) which enables to either open an existing stage (from an history of recent stages) or creates a new one for a given format.
- Ecard number is no longer required and can be left empty.
- First german translation by Philipp Walker.
- [LiveMap](../howtos/live.html) calibration updated with an intuitive UI (click on controls and map).
- Import [template](../guide/stage.html) for category+course.
- IOF XML export for results (for RouteGadget and others).
- Some other minor changes in the UI.

Change in data file format: Geco 1.2 will automatically convert 1.1 stage files to the new format. Meaning also that Geco 1.1 can't load a 1.2 stage (don't forget your backups).


##Version 1.1 - 2011/04/05

[Geco 1.1](http://bitbucket.org/sdenier/geco/downloads/geco1.1-383-20110405-demo.zip) is a move from the custom app for Orient'Show to a full-featured app for regular Orienteering events, with many new features and UI improvements.

The big changes:
- easy registration through CSV import and competitors archive
- automatic mode to handle registration from archive when reading unknown e-cards, with course detection from the trace
- split format for printing and export (OE format for RouteGadget...)
- ability to use registered start times instead of a start box
- translation available in french and english (both app and doc)

UI/Usability changes:
- many UI changes
- list serial ports to let user choose. Detect the serial port where the SI box is connected
- hyperlink navigation to quickly focus on an e-card from the shortlog (runners panel)
- more universal and new keybindings

Other changes:
- new status and stats to better manage special cases (competitors still running, unknown and duplicate e-cards for automatic mode)
- new data fields for each competitor: registered start time, archive id for competitor, flag for rented e-card
- a default course can be linked to a category (use when performing registration through CSV or archive)
- introduce Functions to perform batch operations on data
- CSV export format for French CN (Classement National) + CN simulation in results
- HTML result files can be styled with CSS
- better handling of files with different charsets across platforms

Architecture/Code:
- `Controls` can register themselves as services and get simple access to each other
- refactoring `ResultBuilder` class and related: split between result builder and result/split exporter
- \[Mac\] update to latest Java Mac revision
- some changes in data files to support 1.1 features
