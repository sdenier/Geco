# Requirements

What do you need to run Geco?

- A recent JRE (Java Runtime Environment, version 6+)
- Geco bundle: it includes the application (jar file), template files for a race, user documentation, native libraries for serial communication (RXTX)
- SportIdent drivers 
  - Windows: check sportident website
  - Linux: recent kernels recognize the chip used by SI station, so it's plug'n'play
  - Mac OS X: it's possible to install and tweak a USB driver to get Mac OS X to recognize the station. See the [FAQ](faq.html).

To launch Geco, **execute the geco.jar file**. It should opens automatically if your JRE is correctly configured.

## RXTX library
In some cases, you may need to install and compile RXTX drivers (serial drivers for the Java platform). Contact me if you need some help.
