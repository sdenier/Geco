# Results Panel

The results panel can generate results from current data at any time during a race.

<a href="../images/results_panel.png"><img src="../images/results_panel.png" /></a>

Select either *Courses* or *Categories* to compute results. The list of courses (or categories) appears below the control panel. It is possible to manually select courses or categories for which to compute results. Select *All* to select all sets currently available, and *None* to cancel the selection.

Options for computing results include:
- *Show NC*: include runners ticked as NC in the results. They will appear after the ranked runners, with MPs and others.
- *Show others*: include DNS runners, which were registered but did not run.
- *Show empty sets*: show all courses or categories in results, even if there is not yet any race data.

The three buttons generate results:
- *Refresh* shows results in the right panel.
- *Print* opens a print dialog.
- *Export* opens a file dialog to save results in an external file. Two formats are available, html and csv.
