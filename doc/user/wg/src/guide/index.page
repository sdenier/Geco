# Launcher

The launcher is the first window to pop up when opening Geco. It allows you to open/create a stage.

- To open an existing stage, select the folder with data (just select, do not double-click) and click the Open button.
- To create a new stage, create/select the folder where you want to put data then click the Open button: Geco will propose you to create a new stage by copying some data template.

How to spot a folder with stage data? Simple, it contains a file named `geco.prop` as well as multiple csv files.
