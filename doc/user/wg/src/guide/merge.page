# Merge Dialog

The *Merge Dialog* allows to manage card data after a problem arises: wrong SI number, duplication of runner data, problem when reading the card...

<img src="../images/merge_dialog.png" />

You get the merge dialog when:
- a SI card has been read but no runner with this SI number is registered
- a SI card has been read but the linked runner has some results already
- opening it on the selected runner in the runners table

Three commands are available from the merge dialog:
- *Create* simply creates an anonymous runner (X) with the card data.
- *Close* exits the dialog without further action.
- *Merge* links card data with the runner selected in the combo box.

If you select a runner who already has card data, the *Merge* button changes to *Overwrite* as card data from the selected runner will be **overwritten** with the new card data. This is the only case to handle with care, as it implies some information will be lost.


## Scenarios

Following are typical usage of the *Merge* dialog.


### Unknown Chip

When a SI chip which has not been registered in the system is read, the merge dialog pops up automatically.

- If the runner has been registered but without a chip number or with an incorrect chip number, select him in the combo box then click *Merge*. You are done!

- If the runner has not been registered or if you are unsure, select the course then click *Create* to create an anonymous runner. You can then edit runner information in the table.

- *Close* simply discards card data


### Existing Data for Runner

When a SI chip is read and the linked runner already has card data, the merge dialog pops up automatically. The linked runner is selected by default and the dialog displays an *Overwrite* button.

- If you read again the card for the same runner, just click *Overwrite* to replace previous card data with the new one

- If the runner is different (two runners using the same chip), click *Create* to create a new runner (and start editing) or select and *Merge* with the registered runner

- *Close* simply discards card data


### Merge Card Data

You previously read an unknown chip and you choose to create an anonymous runner. Then you found the registered runner which should be linked with card data. You now want to merge the card data with the registered runner.

1. Select the anonymous runner with the new card data, then open the merge dialog from the Runner pane.

1. Select the registered runner in the combo box of the dialog

1. Click *Merge* or *Overwrite*. The dialog will link the card data with the registered runner

1. Confirm or cancel the deletion of the previous (anonymous) runner

The two other commands are also available:

- *Create* in this mode will duplicate the card data in a new anonymous runner
 
- *Close* just exits the dialog
