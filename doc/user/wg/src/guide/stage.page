## General
- Zero hour: used for older SI cards V5 and registered start times
- Runner archive: path to [archive](archive.html)
- CN base: path to score file for the [french CN](results.html) (national ranking), exported as [CSV](http://cn.ffcorientation.fr/classement)

## SI Reader
- Station port: Geco scans available ports each time you open the dropdown list

This panel also allows you to customize the behavior of Geco when reading ecards (either in racing or training [modes](ecard_modes.html)). You can choose to:

- manually resolve ecard issues with the [Merge wizard](merge.html) *or* let Geco handles all ecards [automatically](../workflows/auto.html), creating an entry for each reading (unknown, duplicate entries)
- let Geco lookup unregistered ecards and insert entries from archive (only for the automatic behavior)
- restrict automatic course detection using [course sets](../workflows/omr.html) per category

## Penalties (for Orient'Show, Free Order, ...)
- MP limit: number of missing punches authorized before marking the runner as MP
- Don't check MP limit: runner can have any number of missing punches without ever being MP (disable MP limit)
- Time penalty: time penalty per missing punch, in seconds (also displayed in minutes for large time penalty)
- Extra penalty: time penalty per <a href="../guide/runners.html#extra">added punch not on course</a>, in seconds (penalize runner who take any control "just in case")

## Course
- Geco can import courses described with the *[IOF XML](http://www.soenniksen.dk/iof-datastandard/index.shtml)* format. Click the *XML* button to select the course file. You can choose between the **XML V2** (current) format or the new **XML V3** format.
- You can set course length, climb, mass start time (optional), or [course set](../workflows/omr.html)
- Course Sets are created on the fly if they do not yet exist
- You can *Edit* the course sequence by hand, if necessary
- You can *Recheck* all runners from a course after a change
  
The **\[Auto\]** course always exists in Geco: it can't be renamed or deleted. This is the default course used by Geco for any new entry (unless a category course is used). This special course tells Geco to detect the *real* course on ecard reading: after reading, the runner course will be automatically updated with the detected course.

## Category
- Course column: set the default course for runners in category (used when importing registrations from file or from archive)
- [Course set](../workflows/omr.html) column: restrict automatic course detection to the given course set for runners in category (tick option in SI reader configuration)
- You can import a CSV *Template* file describing common categories and their default courses. See `data/modeles` for some sample files following french rules. Each line describes a category as `short name, long name, course name`

## Templates

This section allows you to select [custom Mustache templates](../howtos/customresults.html) for exporting and printing results, as well as set up runner splits printing. To start with, **basic templates** are provided in the *formats* folder. If no templates are selected, Geco uses the internal ones.

Three templates are available for stage results: ranking, split times, and custom (which can be used to easily export results in a different format).

You can choose between multi-columns format or single-column 'ticket' (for thermal printer) for the runner splits. The *Prototyping* checkbox makes it easy to quickly change and test template files: instead of printing a split, Geco will open a window with the split and writes a *runner_splits.html* file.
