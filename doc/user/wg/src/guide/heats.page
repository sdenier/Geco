# Heats Panel

The heats panel lets you define how runners in the current stage got qualified for the next stage in knockout qualifications.
Geco takes care of building pools of qualified runners based on results and your specifications.
Pools can be exported directly as start lists for the next stage.

A **heatset** describes how runners got qualified.
Create a **heatset** by clicking the *New* button (or edit an existing heatset by double-clicking on it in the list). It pops up a small window called *Heat Set Editor* which lets you parameterize the heatset:

- give the heatset a name
- give names of heats to put qualified runners into, separated by comma. **Such heats should match courses defined in the next stage**
- give a qualifying rank, which must be attained by a runner to get qualified
- select whether runners are to be drawn according to courses, categories, or the mixed category/courses

Save the heatset parameters. Finally, select in the bottom left list from which courses (or categories) runners should be drawn.

For example, the heatset *Women* in the above figure indicates that runners ranked at most 4th in the W21 category should be qualified.
All qualified runners will be dispatched in two heats, *X* and *Y*, which correspond to courses in the next stage. 

Hit the *Refresh* button to generate and view heats. Hit the *Export* button to export generated heats to a file.
If there is a next stage, Geco will automatically propose to overwrite the startlist of the next stage.

Use *Next stage/Previous stage* buttons in the toolbar to navigate to the next/previous stage in the qualifications. See [Qualifications](../howtos/quals.html) for how to manage qualification series in Geco.
