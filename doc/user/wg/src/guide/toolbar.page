# Toolbar


<img src="../images/toolbar.png" />

The toolbar offers global actions.

- *New/Open* opens the [Launcher](index.html)
- *Save* saves current data on disk. Note that data are [backuped and saved](../howtos/backups.html) automatically at start/exit and regular intervals
- *Previous stage/Next stage* navigate to the indicated stage in qualifications. Only available if current stage is detected as part of qualifications
- *Recheck All* resets all status and all official times for all runners, to be used when a problem affecting results has been detected and fixed.
Be careful with this action as it will also discard any manual modification you may have made.

In addition, the toolbar lets you control the state of the Sportident reader station.

The underneath button indicates that the reader is off. Click it to start the reader and accepts card reading.
