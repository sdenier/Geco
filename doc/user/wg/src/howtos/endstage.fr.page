# Manage end of stage and Not Started runners

The [Stats](../guide/log.html) views in Runners and Log panel give a detailed account of statuses for each course and for the stage. The rule of thumb is that the stage is not done until the number of *unresolved status is not 0*. This includes runners marked as Not Started, Running, but also Unknown and Duplicate entries.

Towards the end of the stage, you should start looking for missing runners. In particular, you need to distinguish between those still running and those who did not start (DNS).
In the classic method, you check the list of Not Started entries against the control list checked by the start team. You manually set the status to either **DNS** or **Running**.

Currently, Geco does not support reading the backup memory of SI stations to handle DNS automatically (planned for 1.2).
