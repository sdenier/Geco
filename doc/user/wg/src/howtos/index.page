# Workflows in auto mode and manual mode

The automatic mode in Geco can handle e-card download without pre-registration. It provides **on-the-fly registration** with an up to date archive. When reading an e-card which is not registered, Geco *looks up the e-card in the archive* and inserts the matching entry in the base. Geco also *detects the course* ran by the competitor from the e-card punches.

In manual mode, Geco does not look up in the archive nor insert new entries automatically. Instead, it raises a [Merge Dialog](../guide/merge.html) to let you handle unknown and duplicate e-cards.
