# Auto mode

The automatic mode in Geco can handle e-card download without pre-registration. It provides **on-the-fly registration** with an up to date archive. When reading an e-card which is not registered, Geco *looks up the e-card in the archive* and inserts the matching entry in the base. Geco also *detects the course* ran by the competitor from the e-card punches.

The schema shows in <font color="blue">blue</font> the two outcomes which require no operation on your part when reading e-cards in auto mode:
- on the left the classic way with **pre-registered** entries;
- on the right the automatic insertion of competitors from **archive**.

Geco also recognizes two different outcomes which require your attention: e-card which can not be found (even in the archive) and e-card already read. For both cases, Geco creates a new entry with e-card data and detect the course, but sets unresolved status Unknown or Duplicate.

These outcomes are shown in <font color="orange">orange</font> in the schema:
- middle left shows the **Duplicate** outcome. It can happen simply if you ask the competitor to read again the e-card, or if a new competitor runs with a previously used e-card;
- middle right shows the **Unknown** outcome. The competitor may have followed on-site registration with a rented e-card. Or the competitor is pre-registered, or in the archive, but his real e-card does not match either because of a typo or because he recently changed it.

Resolve manually these outcomes by following the **<font color="green">green</font>** workflow in the schema. You can edit, delete, merge the new entry to *resolve the case*. If you choose to keep and edit the new entry, don't forget to *recheck or change* the official status. You can also print splits for the competitor.
