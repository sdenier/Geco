# Workflows in auto mode and manual mode

With the introduction of the [automatic mode](auto.html) in Geco 1.1, there are multiple ways you can handle an event and in particular registrations.

Below are two examples of handling events with different styles so that you can compare both workflows. Of course, you can also mix both during the same race: pre-register competitors and run in auto mode to manage special cases.


## Lazy workflow (with auto mode)

The lazy workflow lets you and Geco handle registrations **on the fly**, that is when competitors download their e-cards after their race. This means almost no work at all before the race, but can involve a bit more to handle onsite registrations.

- Geco handles pre-registered e-cards as usual.
- If the e-card has not been registered beforehand, Geco automatically creates an entry with the e-card. It also *detects the course* ran by the competitor from the e-card punches. This eliminates the risk of a mistake in course selection in the entry.
- Geco *looks up in the archive* to fill in registration data for the new e-card entry (name, category, club, ...).
- Otherwise, you will have to edit the entry manually.

Hint: if possible, try to pre-register runners which do not have a personal e-card in the archive (either because they have to rent one or have changed recently).

This workflow is best for trainings and small events.


## Classic workflow (with manual mode)

The classic workflow involves pre-registrations so that work is minimized when competitors download their e-cards.

- Register all known participants beforehand.
- Don't forget to use the archive to quickly insert known competitors.
- Double-check the course.
- You can manage registrations with a spreadsheet application and import a CSV file: fastest way to register lots of competitors.

During the race, you still have to: 
- handle onsite registrations;
- resolve problems with unknown and duplicate e-cards. The [Merge Dialog](../guide/merge.html) pops up.
