# Create parallel pools for qualifications

*Experimental feature - Use with care*

1. Create one stage per pool (each runner has to run in each pool)
1. Create a merging stage to merge all pool results
  1. it should define a `pools.prop` file listing all pool stages to merge
  1. it should define [heatsets](../guide/heats.html) to qualify runners based on merged results
1. Once pools are finished, run pool merger on the merging stage directory with `java -jar gecoXXX.jar valmo.geco.GecoPools <MergingStageDirectory>`
1. the batch run generates files `merged_results.html` and `heats.csv` for the first stage in the knockout series

Notice that only runners having OK results in all pools can be qualified. See *hellemmes\_poolmerge* in the demo samples for an example of merging stage.
